So I'm Thomas and I consider myself a systems developer. I have been writing code since about 2009 (late starter since I'm born in '83) and have been working professionaly as primarily a web-developer a majority of this time with focus on .NET.

I'm living in Västerås, Sweden with my wife and two kids and currently works at Myndigheten för Yrkeshögskolan as a developer with responsibility of the overall systems architecture.
