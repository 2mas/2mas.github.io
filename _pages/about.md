Hey! I'm Thomas and I consider myself a systems developer. I have been writing code since around 2009 and have been working professionaly a web-developer a majority of this time with focus on C# and cloud technologies.

I live in Västerås, Sweden with my wife and two kids and currently works as a systems developer.

The idea behind this site is for me to try to share some knowledge occasionally, almost every day I solve complex issues and I'm probably what they would call a 'ghost-coder' or <a href="https://www.hanselman.com/blog/dark-matter-developers-the-unseen-99" target="_blank">Dark matter developer</a> :)

It means I get stuff done but very rarely writes about it unfortunately. Some of the reasons for this is that I almost exclusively work on company-related stuff that I can't share with the world, but the idea behind this site is to write more general tips and tricks.
