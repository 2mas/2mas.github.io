Hey! I'm Thomas and I consider myself a systems developer. I have been writing code since around 2009 and have been working professionaly a web-developer a majority of this time with focus on C# and cloud technologies.

I live in Västerås, Sweden with my wife and two kids and currently works as a systems developer.
